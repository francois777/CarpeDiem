      Carpe Diem Camping grounds is in Hekpoort, between the Magalies mountains
      and the Water mountains. The Hekpoort creek flows in the valley through
      the beautiful 14 hectar bushfarm. This was a popular 4x4 track previously.
      The  stream is full of fish, frogs and crab and you may also encounter
      Hekpoort's  baboon family. In addition, you may also see meerkats,
      porcupines and a great variety of bird species. An old English blockhouse,
      Bartons' Folly, boasts against the mountain. Expect to see breathtaking
      sunrises and sunsets.
    ps_118v24: |-
      This is the day that the Lord has made; let us rejoice and be glad in it.
