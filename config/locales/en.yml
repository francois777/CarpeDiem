# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

      Carpe Diem Camping grounds is in Hekpoort, between the Magalies mountains
      and  the Water mountains. The Hekpoort creek flows in the valley through
      the beautiful 14 hectar bushfarm. This was a popular 4x4 track previously.
      The  stream is full of fish, frogs and crab and you may also encounter
      Hekpoort's  baboon family. In addition, you may also see meerkats,
      porcupines and a great variety of bird species. An old English blockhouse,
      Bartons' Folly, boasts against the mountain. Expect to see breathtaking
      sunrises and sunsets.
