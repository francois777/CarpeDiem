# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

      Carpe Diem Camping grounds is in Hekpoort, between the Magalies mountains
      and  the Water mountains. The Hekpoort creek flows in the valley through
      the beautiful 14 hectar bushfarm. This was a popular 4x4 track previously.
      The  stream is full of fish, frogs and crab and you may also encounter
      Hekpoort's  baboon family. In addition, you may also see meerkats,
      porcupines and a great variety of bird species. An old English blockhouse,
      Bartons' Folly, boasts against the mountain. Expect to see breathtaking
      sunrises and sunsets.

      This is the day that the Lord has made; let us rejoice and be glad in it.
